# Project Task List - COMPLETED FEATURES

## Completed Tasks

### Backend Setup (Core MVP)
- [x] Review TASK.md against BRD.md and PRD.md to add any missing steps.
- [x] Initialize Prisma and define schema for Nodes, Sources, and Conflicts.
- [x] Create API route `/api/research/nodes` to fetch initial exploration data.
- [x] Create API route `/api/research/outline` (POST) that accepts an array of node IDs and a detail level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and returns dynamically structured outline content.
- [x] Set up Gemini and OpenAI API integrations.

### Frontend Development (Core MVP)
- [x] Set up the main page layout: a primary panel for visualization and a sidebar for the outline builder.
- [x] Implement the visualization canvas area (placeholder for D3.js integration).
- [x] Create the `Outline Builder` component in the sidebar.
- [x] Create the `Adjustable Detail Slider` component using Shadcn/UI.
- [x] Create dedicated long-form text editor interface.
- [x] Implement basic text formatting (bold, italics, headings) in editor.

### State Management & Interactivity
- [x] Set up client-side state management (Zustand or React Query) for the outline's state (list of nodes, order).
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop functionality (React DnD) to move nodes from the visualization into the outline.
- [x] Implement selection functionality (checkbox on nodes) as an alternative to drag-and-drop.
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop reordering of items *within* the `Outline Builder`.
- [x] Connect the `Adjustable Detail Slider` state to the API call for the outline content. When the slider moves, re-fetch the outline with the new detail level.
- [x] Implement tools to indicate comparisons and relationships within the outline.

### Features
- [x] Implement the "Clear Outline" button functionality.
- [x] Implement the "Export Outline" feature (initially to Markdown, then PDF/DOCX).

### Visualization (Core MVP)
- [x] Integrate D3.js with React for the main exploration graph.
- [x] Render nodes fetched from the backend API.
- [x] Ensure nodes in the visualization are interactive (clickable for details, draggable for outline).
- [x] Implement basic search and filtering within the knowledge graph.

### AI Writing Assistant (Core MVP)
- [x] Implement LLM-powered generation of outlines based on user-selected nodes.
- [x] Implement LLM-powered generation of draft content based on outline/knowledge graph.
- [x] Implement ability to expand, refine, or rephrase text sections using AI.

### AI-Powered Dashboard Integration
- [x] Implement functionality to summarize chat content.
- [x] Use the summary to dynamically generate nodes for the dashboard.
- [x] Ensure seamless integration with the existing visualization and outline builder.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] Set up basic Jest tests for outline manipulation functions.
- [x] Test critical user flows (adding nodes, reordering, exporting).
- [x] Implement basic error handling for API failures.

### Documentation
- [x] Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI.
- [x] Document component usage with Storybook.
- [x] Write developer setup guide.
- [x] Document database schema and relationships.
- [x] Create comprehensive authentication documentation.
- [x] Document security and accessibility features.
