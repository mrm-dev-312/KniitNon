## üé® Recent D3.js Visualization Improvements (COMPLETED)

The D3.js force-directed graph has been significantly enhanced with the following improvements:

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Node Spacing & Layout
- **Stabilized force simulation**: Fixed spinning issue with velocity decay and better alpha settings
- **Hierarchical node sizing**: Root=45px, Level1=35px, Level2=25px, Level3=20px (scaling down for deeper levels)
- **Size-aware repulsion**: Larger nodes have stronger repulsion to maintain visual hierarchy
- **Adaptive link distances**: Scale with node size (radius * 3 + 60px base)
- **Improved collision detection**: Prevents overlapping while maintaining organic layout

### ‚úÖ Color Theory-Based Node Colorization (6 Schemes)
1. **Analogous** (Harmonious): Red ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Amber ‚Üí Lime ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Cyan ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Violet
2. **Triadic** (High Contrast): Red ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Purple ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Cyan ‚Üí Lime  
3. **Complementary** (Opposite Colors): Red ‚Üî Emerald, Blue ‚Üî Amber, Violet ‚Üî Lime, Rose ‚Üî Cyan
4. **Tetradic** (Four Color Wheel): Red ‚Üí Amber ‚Üí Emerald ‚Üí Blue (90¬∞ intervals)
5. **Monochromatic** (Professional Blue): Navy ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Medium Blue ‚Üí Light Blue ‚Üí Very Light Blue
6. **Heat Map** (Intensity): Dark Red ‚Üí Red ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Amber ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Lime ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Emerald

### ‚úÖ User Interface Controls
- **Color scheme selector**: Dropdown with 6 theory-based options
- **Responsive updates**: Color changes applied instantly via useEffect
- **Visual depth indicators**: Depth numbers displayed on nodes
- **Drill-down controls**: Interactive + buttons for expansion

### ‚úÖ Technical Improvements
- **Force simulation optimization**: Better parent-child vs. sibling relationships
- **Performance enhancements**: Limited repulsion distance, optimized collision detection  
- **Unlimited depth support**: API and frontend handle arbitrary taxonomic levels
- **Stable connections**: Prevents nodes from flying off while maintaining organic layout

These improvements create a visually clear, scientifically color-coded, and spaciously organized force-directed graph that supports deep taxonomic exploration while maintaining intuitive navigation and professional aesthetics.
