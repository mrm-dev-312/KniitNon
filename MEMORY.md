# Project Memory and Decisions Log: KniitNon
## Architectural Decisions
* 2025-07-08: Initial project setup using the optimal AI-First Next.js stack.
* 2025-07-08: Added Docker support for consistent development and production environments.
## Task Management
* 2025-07-08: Reviewed and updated TASK.md based on BRD.md and PRD.md.
* 2025-07-08: Confirmed Prisma schema for Nodes, Sources, and Conflicts is already defined.
* 2025-07-08: Created placeholder API route for `/api/research/nodes`.
* 2025-07-08: Created placeholder API route for `/api/research/outline` (POST).
* 2025-07-08: Configured `app/api/chat/route.ts` to support both OpenAI and Gemini API integrations.
* 2025-07-08: Identified lack of automated tests and added a task to set up a testing framework.
* 2025-07-08: Implemented basic two-column layout for main page.
* 2025-07-08: Prepared visualization canvas area for D3.js integration.
* 2025-07-08: Created and integrated `OutlineBuilder` component.
## Lessons Learned
* 2025-07-09: Debugging revealed that VisualizationCanvas was clearing localStorage immediately after loading, causing fallback to default/example nodes.
* 2025-07-09: Enhanced localStorage persistence by adding a timestamp and keeping generated data for 30 minutes.
* 2025-07-09: Improved API data transformation logic to ensure consistency (`children` â†’ `connections`).
* 2025-07-09: Added detailed debugging logs to trace data flow and timing.
* 2025-07-09: Created a comprehensive HTML test page to simulate and verify the full workflow.
* 2025-07-09: Restarted the dev server and verified the fix works: generated nodes now persist and display in the dashboard as intended.
## Debugging and Fixes
* 2025-07-09: Debugged and fixed the chat-to-dashboard workflow to ensure research nodes generated from chat persist and display in the dashboard.
* 2025-07-09: Enhanced localStorage persistence for generated research data with a 30-minute expiration using timestamps.
* 2025-07-09: Improved API data transformation logic to handle both `connections` and `children` fields.
* 2025-07-09: Added detailed debugging logs to VisualizationCanvas for data flow and timing.
* 2025-07-09: Created a comprehensive HTML test page (workflow-test.html) to simulate and verify the full workflow (API call, localStorage, dashboard load).
* 2025-07-09: Restarted the dev server and verified the fix: generated nodes now persist and display in the dashboard as intended.
* 2025-07-09: Documented all lessons learned in MEMORY.md and summarized the debugging/fix process in TASK.md.

## Critical Architecture Lessons Learned (July 2025)
* 2025-07-10: **CRITICAL**: Discovered Docker build failures due to client/server component architecture mismatch
  - Issue: Next.js attempting static generation on client-heavy components causes `clientModules` error
  - Root cause: Heavy use of 'use client' directives throughout app conflicts with static generation
  - Impact: Docker builds fail at "Generating static pages" phase, preventing production deployment
  - Solution: Requires hybrid architecture with strategic server/client component separation

* 2025-07-10: **Next.js App Router Architecture Insights**:
  - `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` exports must come AFTER imports but BEFORE component definition
  - Client components should be "islands" within server components for optimal performance
  - Static generation incompatible with client-heavy applications without proper configuration
  - Server Actions provide better pattern for data operations than client-side API calls

* 2025-07-10: **Docker Build Optimization Requirements**:
  - Project naming inconsistency (aipodcastgen vs kniitnon) needs resolution
  - Environment variables must disable static optimization for client-heavy apps
  - Dockerfile needs development/production environment handling for Next.js builds
  - Container architecture should support standalone output mode

* 2025-07-10: **Production Readiness Assessment**:
  - Project marked as "production-ready" but Docker builds failing = NOT truly production-ready
  - Architecture refactoring required before genuine production deployment
  - Need systematic server/client component boundary documentation
  - Performance optimization requires data fetching migration to server components
