# Best Practices for Scaffolding a New Project

## User Prompt: Thinking Through Your Project
Before starting a new project, consider the following:
- What is the primary goal of the project?
- Who are the stakeholders and target audience?
- What are the key features and deliverables?
- What technologies and tools will be used?
- What is the expected timeline and budget?

## AI Prompt: Assisting in Building the Project
"AI, help me scaffold a new project with the following requirements: [Insert requirements]. Include folder structures, boilerplate code, setup scripts, and CI/CD workflows."

## Best Practices

### Use a Project Template
- Create a GitHub repository template with pre-configured folder structures, boilerplate code, and documentation.
- Include essential files like `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Automate Setup with Scripts
- Provide setup scripts (e.g., `setup.sh` or `setup.ps1`) to automate tasks like installing dependencies, creating databases, and running migrations.

### Include CI/CD Configuration
- Add GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, linting, and deployment.

### Predefine Environment Variables
- Include `.env.example` files with placeholders for environment variables.

### Document Everything
- Include detailed documentation for setup, development, testing, and deployment.

## Scaffold Example for AI Podcast Generator
Here’s a boilerplate structure for a project like AI Podcast Generator:

```plaintext
PROJECT NAME/
├── backend/
│   ├── alembic/          # Database migrations
│   ├── core/             # Core utilities and models
│   ├── tests/            # Backend tests
│   ├── app/              # API routes and services
│   ├── Dockerfile        # Backend Docker configuration
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/              # React components and pages
│   ├── public/           # Static assets
│   ├── tests/            # Frontend tests
│   ├── Dockerfile        # Frontend Docker configuration
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md         # Project overview
│   ├── DATABASES.md      # Database documentation
│   ├── ROADMAP.md        # Project roadmap
│   ├── TASKS.md          # Task tracking
│   ├── testing/
│   │   ├── test-strategy.md
│   │   ├── mock-data.md
├── .env.example          # Example environment variables
├── docker-compose.yml    # Docker Compose setup
├── LICENSE               # License file
├── CONTRIBUTING.md       # Contribution guidelines
├── setup.ps1             # PowerShell setup script
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/
│   │   ├── ci.yml        # GitHub Actions for CI/CD
```

## Tools for Scaffolding

### GitHub Repository Templates
- Create a repository template with the desired structure and boilerplate.
- When starting a new project, use the template to clone the structure.

### Yeoman Generators
- Use Yeoman to create custom generators for scaffolding projects.
- Example: Generate folder structures, boilerplate code, and configuration files.

### Cookiecutter
- Use Cookiecutter to create project templates with predefined structures and scripts.
- Example: A Python-based template for backend projects.

### CLI Tools
- Create a custom CLI tool to automate scaffolding tasks (e.g., generating folders, initializing Git, setting up Docker).

## Recommended Workflow

### Create a GitHub Template Repository
- Include the folder structure, boilerplate code, and documentation.
- Add setup scripts and CI/CD workflows.

### Automate Setup
- Provide scripts for initializing the project (e.g., installing dependencies, creating databases).

### Use the Template for New Projects
- Clone the template repository when starting a new project.

### Iterate and Improve
- Update the template as you refine your workflow and add new features.
